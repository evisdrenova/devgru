# Implementation Plan for Updating Configuration to Use Specific Model "Planner"

## 1. Analysis
The request is to modify the existing configuration to ensure that a specific model, referred to as "planner", is used instead of the default behavior of selecting the first available model. This change is likely aimed at improving the predictability and reliability of the application by ensuring that the desired model is consistently used for processing.

### Objectives:
- Update the configuration to explicitly specify the "planner" model.
- Ensure that the application logic correctly references this model in all relevant areas.

### Rationale:
- Using a specific model can enhance performance and accuracy for tasks that are better suited to the "planner" model.
- It reduces ambiguity in model selection, leading to more consistent results.

## 2. Implementation Steps
### Step 1: Identify Configuration Location
- Locate the configuration file or section in the codebase where model selection is defined.

### Step 2: Modify Configuration
- Change the configuration to specify the "planner" model explicitly.
  - If the configuration is in a JSON/YAML format, update the relevant key-value pair.
  - If the configuration is in code (e.g., Python, Java), update the variable or constant that holds the model reference.

### Step 3: Update Model Selection Logic
- Review the code that handles model selection to ensure it no longer defaults to the first model.
- Implement logic to check for the existence of the "planner" model and handle cases where it may not be available.

### Step 4: Documentation
- Update any relevant documentation to reflect the change in model selection.
- Include information on why the "planner" model is preferred and how to configure it.

### Step 5: Code Review
- Submit the changes for peer review to ensure adherence to coding standards and project guidelines.

### Step 6: Merge Changes
- Once approved, merge the changes into the main branch of the code repository.

## 3. Files/Components Affected
- **Configuration File**: The primary file where model settings are defined (e.g., `config.json`, `config.yaml`, or equivalent).
- **Model Selection Logic**: Any files that contain the logic for selecting models (e.g., `model_selector.py`, `model_manager.java`).
- **Documentation**: Any markdown or documentation files that describe the configuration and model usage (e.g., `README.md`, `CONFIGURATION.md`).

## 4. Testing Strategy
### Unit Testing
- Create or update unit tests to verify that the "planner" model is being used correctly.
  - Test cases should confirm that the model selection logic correctly identifies and uses the "planner" model.
  - Ensure that the application behaves as expected when the "planner" model is specified.

### Integration Testing
- Conduct integration tests to verify that the application functions correctly with the "planner" model in a complete environment.
  - Check that all components interact properly with the "planner" model.

### Regression Testing
- Run existing test suites to ensure that the change does not introduce any new issues or regressions in functionality.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- If applicable, have stakeholders or end-users validate that the application meets their requirements with the "planner" model in use.

### Documentation Review
- Ensure that the updated documentation accurately reflects the changes and is clear for users.

By following this structured implementation plan, we can ensure a smooth transition to using the "planner" model while maintaining application integrity and performance.
